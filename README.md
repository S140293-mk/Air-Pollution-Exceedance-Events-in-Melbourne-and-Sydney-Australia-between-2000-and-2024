# Air-Pollution-Exceedance-Events-in-Melbourne-and-Sydney-Australia-between-2000-and-2024

This repository contains the data, analysis, and scripts used in the study on air pollution exceedance events in Melbourne and Sydney from 2000 to 2024. The study evaluates long-term air quality trends, compliance with World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines and national standards, and the spatiotemporal distribution of air pollution events. It highlights challenges in data coverage and compares the air quality monitoring networks of both cities.

Key aspects covered:
- Analysis of NO₂, PM₂.₅, PM₁₀, and O₃ concentrations over 24 years.
- Identification and classification of single and multi-pollutant air pollution exceedance events.
- Spatiotemporal patterns and long-term trends in air quality.
- Comparison of air quality monitoring coverage in Melbourne and Sydney.

The repository provides Python scripts and supporting data for reproducible analysis, offering insights into urban air pollution trends and the effectiveness of existing air quality monitoring networks.
